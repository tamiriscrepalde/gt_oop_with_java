# Module 1

## Module Overview
This module covers the following Lessons:
- **Lesson 1: Introduction to Java**: [Brief description]
- **Lesson 2: Why Object-Oriented Programming?**: [Brief description]

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1. The history of Java
2. The basic elements of Java program
3. How to execute programs using the language's virtual machine approach to translation
4. Gain a basic understanding of the motivation behind object-oriented programming
5. Understand how to begin thinking of problem solutions in terms of classes and objects


## Key Learnings and Reflections
- The main difference between compiled and interpreted languages is the execution process.
    - A compiler translates one high level language to computer language, generates other files and the program can only be executed after the compilation.
    - Compiler languages are faster because it only needs to be compiled once. But it must be developer for a specific processor.
    - Interpred languages are translated to machine language at running time and this process doesn't generate intermediary files.
    - Although interpred languages are not so fast as compiled ones, they're processor independent. Which means they can run in different computers and platforms more easily.
- Java is a programming language that takes a hybrid execution approach to try taking advantage of compiled and interpred languages.
    - A compiler will generate what is known as bytecode and will store it on a .class file. The bytecode is not specific to a processor like compiled languages, but it's close to machine language, diferently of interpred languages.
- Although, Java has an unique sintaxe, its logics are very close to Fortran.
